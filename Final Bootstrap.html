False and exaggerated portrals in the media continue to be damaging to the mental health of developing youth, and shows that aim to tackle “teen” issues can sometimes inspire rather than bring awareness. </p>

                    <p> Unrealistic body images and false portrayals in the media have been a longheld issue for consumers. In today’s social media age, media is consumed by even younger audiences than ever before. According to 

                        <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/?menuItem=3814afe3-3f3c-4623-910b-8a6a37885ab8"> Pew Research</a>, 

                    84% of adults aged 18-29 use at least one source of social media, where they can – and ultimately will – consume data involving false body types, portrayals, and realities. Licensed Clinical Practicing Counselor Nina Esshaki said 10 out of 10 times, social media worsens an individual’s mental health. </p>
                    <p> Social media, however, is not the only form of media consumed by many young adults. The advent of streaming websites means young adults are more easily able to access television and movie media. A 2021 article from

                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2021/10/07/media-habits-are-changing-rapidly-for-young-adults-making-targeting-more-challenging/?sh=2448ac223303"> Forbes</a> 

                    stated that young adults aged 18-24 were more likely to stream video content when compared to older adults, with 44% of young adults streaming over three hours of video content each day. While television is nothing new, this media content has the potential to be harmful to viewers as well, especially when propelled by social media. </p>

            <h3> The problem with "real" television shows</h3>
                    <p>No matter how down-to-earth and honest a television show aims to be, there will always be part that is unrealistic for someone. Because of this, many television shows aimed towards teens strive to cover a wide variety of tough topics that more family-friendly shows do not. Mental health, addiction, and sex are all common topics in many of today’s teen shows, such as <i>13 Reasons Why </i> and <i>Riverdale</i>. While many of these subjects are ones teens should talk about, many shows marketed towards youth can lead young adults down a path of self-identifying rather than awareness. In terms of mental health, Esshaki said self-diagnosing has become a recent issue on media platforms, specifically TikTok. </p>
                    <p>“Teens and younger people are becoming more versed in the language of mental health without necessarily having the professional backing or support or data behind that. So they will self-identify and self-diagnose,” Ekkhrati said. </p>

                    <h3>False portrayals in the media </h3>
                    <p>Media today continues to mislead young adults into false body images. With adults in their late 20s playing children in designer clothes on screen, it’s no wonder children are growing up faster now than ever. This phenomenon of growing up too fast can be seen across hundreds of today’s shows. Among over 200 of the 21st century’s teenage characters in shows marketed towards young adults, female actors saw a greater difference in age to their characters than that of males. While casting, experience, and work hours are all considerations for casting companies, these gaps in age provide an avenue for viewers to fall into false portrayals in the media. Ekkhrati said she believes girls are often more effected by body image issues than their male counterparts, but the experience isn't just limited to what's on the big screen. Ekkhrati says she  has seen TikTok further perpetuate this concept as well.  </p>
                    <p>“Girls [on TikTok] specifically ages nine to twelve-ish, are more exposed a little bit too early on. They feel more sexualized and this kind of need to be more physical at just a developmentally inappropriate time”, Ekkhrati said. </p>

                    <h3> The future of media</h3>
                    <p>While the use of older actors may always stick around, there have been a handful of recent directors making an effort to appropriate their films and shows. In an interview with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/09/10/greta-gerwig-gave-saoirse-ronan-acne-toronto-film-festival-hit-lady-bird/651170001/"> USA Today </a>, Writer-director of <i>Ladybird</i> Greta Gerwig claims she was tired of seeing teenage girls in movies with “perfect skin and perfect hair, even if they’re supposed to be awkward,” when the average teenage experience is marked by acne and bad hair days. There are many of today’s shows going to efforts to ground their characters amid the sped-up development caused by much of that seen in media. <i>Glee</i> creator Ryan Murphy made an effort to graduate the characters in real time after the third season, saying “There’s nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot,” in an interview with the <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/404.php"> Herald Sun</a>. As the phenomenon of increased maturity in media continues, directors like these give hope for a future of change. </p>
